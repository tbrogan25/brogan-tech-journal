# [Tim Brogan's Tech Journals](https://github.com/tbrogan25/brogan-tech-journal/wiki)
Within this Wiki, you'll find detailed notes on the technical processes and experiences I encounter in school, work, and on my own. Includes: brief to detailed summaries of work but also documentation of new topics and information. Documenting helps me remember -- that's why I have my name at the top, I'd forget it otherwise.
